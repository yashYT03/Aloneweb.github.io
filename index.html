      <h2>MY first alone experience</h2>
      <p>
        Living alone is a totally new experience. A long journey comes with surprises, ups, and downs. also made me realize, that adulthood can sometimes be damn lonely. and of course, living alone teaches you lots of new stuff which you thought you will never learn.
To be totally honest, I always have the privilege of mom and dad who take care of all the basic needs from cooking, cleaning, shopping for groceries, and more. Moving from spoon-fed lifestyle to independent life is obviously tough. Life takes different turns and modes when you start living alone. So far I love the freedom and self-realization of the basic needs that comes with solitude along with different drawbacks as well. let me list down the perks of living alone.

        <h2> hence you live alone</h2>
        <p>For most, it means traveling independently of your friends, family members or significant others. You might still join organized tours in your destination, stay with other people, and meet and spend time with new friends that you meet along the way.

            For me, solo travel usually means the complete freedom to experience a destination the way I want to. I can eat at the restaurants I want to eat at, hit up the tourist sites and museums that seem most interesting to me, and skip the rest.</p>
